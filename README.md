This is a dbt project that transforms data from the [California School Dashboard](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/) to project current [charter school performance categories](https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ch/performcategory.asp) used in the [charter school renewal](https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ch/renewalprocess.asp) process. 

Background:

In California, charter school renewals are largely dependent on each schools' assigned performance category that is determined by the school's performance on state dashboard indicators. Although schools have access to the data they need to determine their performance category, the process for making this determination is quite technical and complicated, so the California Department of Education releases a data file with each schools' performance category. All state dashboard data for the 2022-23 school year was made available in December 2023, but it is unclear when the state will release its official performance category data file, making it difficult for some schools to prepare for upcoming renewals. This dbt project transforms available data to project performance categories. Please note, state hasn't fully published their methodology, so there may be some minor variation in these projected categories versus the official categories that the state will ultimately release.
